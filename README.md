# Scord_server
The server part of [Scord app](https://github.com/TheSapphRyz/Scord).

To start your own server you should do: get a static external IP, dowload [the lastest realese]() run it and copy IPv4 in server console. Thats all! 

If you dowload old realese - clients and server will crash. To avoid this, be sure to download the latest version of the server.
